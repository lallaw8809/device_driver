Introduction:
-------------
Program to write basic character driver, create a device node and
pass data between user space and kernel space.

device_class.c     : sample code for character driver.
			Register a char driver with a dynamic major number.
			Register char driver with file system structure.
			Create a device mode under /dev directory which is used to
			 communicate b/w user and kernel space.

Procedure to run teh code :
---------------------------

$ make                           //compile the code
$ sudo insmod device_class.ko    //insert the driver
$ dmesg | tail                   //check print logs with major number
$ cat /proc/devices              //Validate the device register with a driver
$ ls /sys/class/Char-class       //Validation of device Class
$ ls -il /dev/CharDriver         //Validation of device node
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/CharDriver //Change permission of devcie node
$ echo 1 > /dev/CharDriver       //Write a data on device node
$ sudo  rmmod device_class       //Remove the kernal module 
$ sudo rm -rf /dev/CharDriver    //Remove the device node
