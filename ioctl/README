IOCTL :
-------
	IOCTL is the way to communicate between kernel space and user space.
	IOCTL is referred as Input and Output Control (Integer values), which
	is used to talking to device drivers.

Kernel Space vs User Space  :
--------------------------------
	OS segregated the virtual memory into kernel and user space.
	Kernel space is reserved for running kernel, kernel extension and device driver.
	User space : All of the user space application is ruuning here and it will swapped,
	if necessary.

Procedure to run the code :
---------------------------

$ make
$ sudo insmod ioctl.ko
$ dmesg      //check the module insertion and validate the registered major number
$ sudo mknod /dev/ioctl_driver c 245 0 
$ sudo  chmod 777 /dev/ioctl_driver
$ ./app
