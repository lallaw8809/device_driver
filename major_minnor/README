Major and Minor Number :
------------------------
Linux kernel represents character and block devices as a pair of numbers <major,minor>
Major number can be assigned to drive at dynamic/staic.
At the removal time the major number is removed by kernel.

dynamic : Show the program to assign major and minor number dynamically.
static  : Show the program to assign major and minor number statically.

Major Number :
--------------
The major number identifies the software/driver associated with the hardware/device.
The kernel uses the major number to identify the device.
Some major numbers are reserved for particular device drivers by default. 
Other major numbers are dynamically assigned to a device driver when Linux boots. 	

Minor Number :
-------------
The device driver uses the minor number to distinguish individual physical or logical devices.
The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number.
minor number provides a way for the driver to differ entiate among them.

User space programs access character and block devices through device nodes also referred 
to as device special files. When a device node is created, it is associated with a major 
and minor number.

How to create a device node under /dev directory :
--------------------------------------------------

mknod /dev/<driver_name> c <major_number> <minor_number : range <0-255> >
