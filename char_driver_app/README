Introduction:
-------------
Program to write basic character driver and pass data between 
user space and kernel space.

char_driver_app.c : sample code for character driver.
			Register a char driver with a dynamic major number.
			Register char driver with file system structure.
application.c     : User space program to,
			Open the char driver.
			write a string to the driver.
			Read back the written string from driver.
			Close the driver.

Procedure to run teh code :
---------------------------

$ make                           //compile the code
$ sudo insmod char_driver_app.ko //insert the driver
$ dmesg | tail                   //check print logs with major number
$ cat /proc/devices              //Validate the device register with a driver
$ sudo mknod /dev/CharDriver c <major> <minor> //create a node
$ sudo ./app //write and read back the string from LKM
$ sudo  rmmod char_driver_app   //Remove the kernal module 
$ sudo rm -rf /dev/CharDriver //Remove the device node
