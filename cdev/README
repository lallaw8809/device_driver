cdev :
------
In linux kernel, struct inode is used to represent the files.
struct inode has all the information about files.

struct cdev is a member of inode structure.
The struct cdev is the kernelâ€™s internal structure that represents char devices and
represent a character device within the kernel.  

struct cdev encapsulates the file_operations structure and some other important
driver information(major/minor no). It is the new way of registering character driver
with kernel. 

Procedure to run the code :
---------------------------
$ make                       //Compile the code
$ sudo insmod cdev.ko        //Insert the module
$ dmesg                      //check the print logs
$ cat /proc/devices          //check the char driver registration
$ sudo mknod /dev/cdev c <major_num> 0 //create a device node
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/cdev   //change the permission
$ echo 1 > /dev/cdev         //write into device node
$ cat /dev/cdev              //read into device node
$ sudo rmmod cdev 	     //Remove the module
